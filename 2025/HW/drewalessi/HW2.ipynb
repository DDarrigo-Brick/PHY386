As far as I can tell, the results look plausible. The AI added terms to account for the extra forces coming from a mass's 4 nearest neighbors (2 on each side) rather than just their closest neighbors as in our example.\n",

Perplexity had a tendency to jump into very complex, nonlinear solutions which I didn't feel confident in my ability to assess. Magnets were a popular theme. Generally, when I tried to get it to simplify its solution it would revert to something very similar to our homework problem, which no longer seemed very creative. Ultimately, this led me to look for a different AI."
