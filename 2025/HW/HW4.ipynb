        "A **data type** is a classification of data that determines the kind of value a variable can hold and what operations can be performed on it. In Python, data types are classes, and variables are instances of these classes. Python supports various built-in data types, including:\n",

        "- **Numeric types**: `int`, `float`, `complex`  \n",
        "  (e.g., photon numbers, probabilities, amplitudes)\n",

        "  (e.g., lists of quantum states)\n",
        "- **Text type**: `str`  \n",
        "  (e.g., state labels or descriptions)\n",
        "- **Mapping type**: `dict`  \n",
        "  (e.g., parameter dictionaries for circuits)\n",
        "- **Set types**: `set`, `frozenset`\n",
        "- **Boolean type**: `bool`  \n",
        "  (e.g., flags for conditions)\n",

        "2. **Dynamic Type Checking**:\n",

        "3. **ArrayLike**: Used for input data in vector/matrix representation of quantum objects.\n",
