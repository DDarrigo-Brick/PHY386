Introduction\n","\n","This is your final project for this class!\n","\n","In this project, you will analyze images of Jupiter and its moons taken over several nights. Your goal is to track the motion of the **Galilean moons** (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) relative to the background stars and determine their orbital motion. You will reconstruct the orbits of these moons using the positional data you extract from the images.\n","\n","**Project Topic:** Tracking the motion of the moons of Jupiter.\n","\n","**Key Focus:** Orbital mechanics, time-series analysis, astrometry.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c2dbb2ef","metadata":{"id":"c2dbb2ef"},"source":["## 2. Learning Objectives\n","\n","By completing this project, you will:\n","- Learn to extract positional data of moving objects from astronomical images.\n","- Understand the concepts of **orbital mechanics** as applied to Jupiter's moons.\n","- Track the motion of celestial bodies over time and reconstruct their orbits.\n","- Document your process clearly in a reproducible way.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"82dc9058","metadata":{"id":"82dc9058"},"source":["## 3. Dataset Description\n","\n","**You will receive:**\n","- A series of raw timelapses and fits images showing Jupiter and its moons.\n","\n","The images can include:\n","- Metadata about the observation, including telescope settings and time of capture.\n","- The images are RGB, with Jupiter and its moons clearly visible.\n","\n","**Note:** Due to visibility constraints, only short durations (approximately 20 minutes) can be captured each night. This means the moons' positions will need to be tracked over multiple nights to reconstruct their orbits.\n","\n","You will use this data to extract the positions of the moons relative to background stars and calculate their orbital motion.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"57b6cf8d","metadata":{"id":"57b6cf8d"},"source":["## 4.
