Introduction\n","\n","This is your final project for this class!\n","\n","In this project, you will analyze the brightness of the Sun across its disk to study the phenomenon known as **limb darkening**. The goal is to measure how the Sun’s intensity decreases from the center to the edge (limb) and to model this behavior mathematically.\n","\n","You will use a FITS image of the Sun to extract brightness profiles at different radial distances from the center. Using these profiles, you will fit a theoretical limb darkening function and interpret what this tells us about the structure of the Sun’s atmosphere.\n","\n","**Project Topic:** Measuring and modeling the limb darkening effect of the Sun.\n","\n","**Key Focus:** Image analysis, brightness profiles, radiative modeling.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"88050e6d","metadata":{"id":"88050e6d"},"source":["## 2.
