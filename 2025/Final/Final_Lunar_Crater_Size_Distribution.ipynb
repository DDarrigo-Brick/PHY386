Introduction\n","\n","This is your final project for this class!\n","\n","In this project, you will analyze a high-resolution image of the lunar surface to measure the size distribution of craters. Your objective is to identify craters, measure their diameters, and analyze how crater sizes are distributed across the image. From this, you will estimate the relative ages of different regions of the Moon based on crater density.\n","\n","You will also explore how impact processes shape planetary surfaces and what crater populations can tell us about the history of the Moonâ€™s surface.\n","\n","**Project Topic:** Measuring lunar crater sizes and estimating surface ages.\n","\n","**Key Focus:** Image analysis, crater measurement, statistical distribution.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8c0f7cde","metadata":{"id":"8c0f7cde"},"source":["## 2.
