Introduction\n","\n","This is your final project for this class!\n","\n","In this project, you will analyze a FITS image of a nebula captured using narrowband filters, specifically H-alpha (656 nm) and OIII (501 nm). The filtered image is still an RGB image, where each channel represents a specific emission line. Your goal is to reconstruct the individual emission line images from the RGB data to study the nebula's structure and composition.\n","\n","**Project Topic:** Narrowband imaging and emission line extraction.\n","\n","**Key Focus:** Spectral line isolation, nebula analysis, image processing.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7dde7c3c","metadata":{"id":"7dde7c3c"},"source":["## 2.
