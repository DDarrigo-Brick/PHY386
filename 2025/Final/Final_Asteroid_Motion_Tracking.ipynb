Introduction\n","\n","This is your final project for this class!\n","\n","In this project, you will analyze the motion of an asteroid captured in a sequence of astronomical images taken over several nights. The objective is to track the asteroid's position relative to background stars, calculate its apparent speed, and model its trajectory.\n","\n","You will work with a sequence of FITS images that show both stars and a moving asteroid. The challenge is to identify the asteroid in each frame, extract its coordinates, and analyze how it moves across the sky. By measuring its displacement over time, you will estimate the asteroid's velocity in arcseconds per hour and discuss how astronomers predict asteroid paths.\n","\n","**Project Topic:** Tracking asteroid motion using time-series astronomical data.\n","\n","**Key Focus:** Object detection, coordinate measurement, motion analysis."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"51642532","metadata":{"id":"51642532"},"source":["## 2.
